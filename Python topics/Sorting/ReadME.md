#### Bubble Sort
* Compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the algorithm progresses.

    > time complexity of O(n^2) in the average

#### Selection Sort
* It works by dividing the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
* Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Sorts without requiring additional memory.

    > time complexity of O(n^2)

#### Insertion Sort
* Algorithm that works by dividing the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It iterates through the unsorted part and inserts each element into its correct position within the sorted part. 
* Performs well on small lists or partially sorted lists and has an advantage of being an in-place sorting algorithm (it doesn't require extra memory space)

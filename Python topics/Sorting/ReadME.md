#### Bubble Sort
* Compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the algorithm progresses.
    > time complexity of O(n^2) in the average


#### Selection Sort
* It works by dividing the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
* Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Sorts without requiring additional memory.
